How to contribute to BIBISH

Did you find a bug?
* Make sure that there is not a duplicate bug in the issues tab on the github
  page. Be sure to check both open and closed issues.
* If there is not already an issue, be as clear and concise as possible about
  what happened and how it might be reproduced.

Did you write a patch to fix an issue?
* In addition to writing a bug report, you should submit a pull request with
  your proposed changes for review.

Do you want to add a feature or functionality to BIBISH?
* Create a new feature issue or discussion, and a pull request once you have
  code written for said feature.
* BIBISH is being designed to have as few dependencies as possible. So consider
  very carefully any changes that add new dependencies to the project. If a
  dependency can be included in one of the existing dependencies (for example
  the SWORD Project) then that will be accepted more easily than a dependency
  that directly impacts BIBISH
* Current dependencies of BIBISH are:
  * cmake
  * A C++11 aware compiler
  * The SWORD Project (http://crosswire.org)
  * sys/ioctl.h and unistd.h (To determine terminal size)
* Dependencies that The SWORD Project is typically built against, but are not
  used by BIBISH directly:
  * libz
  * curl
  * icu

Do you want to translate BIBISH into another language?
* Great! We want BIBISH to be useful to as many people as possible. Since an
  i18n package hasn't been decided on yet, start a discussion on github or
  head over to #bibish on the libera.chat irc network and we can get started
  on how best to translate BIBISH.

Do you want to contribute in some way that hasn't been mentioned yet?
* Start a discussion on github or else go to #bibish and  we'll discuss your
  ideas
